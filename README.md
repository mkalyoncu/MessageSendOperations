# Message Send Operations

Message Send Operations is a simple message publishing system.  
There is a text file that includes 1000 usernames of a Linux system in the project.The app bring out packages in Json format for each username in the file.

#### Example of a message
  
```json
{
    "name":"fireman",
    "user_id":
    {
        "hash":"4FE814ABB1ADB58A7788269DE4408C8F",
        "user_id":517
    }
}
```
  
As you see, this package contains more than a username. The app assigns auto incremented id numbers and hash values(which are generated by DigestUtils) for each username.
